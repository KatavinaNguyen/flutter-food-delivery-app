## Flutter Mobile Food Delivery App
*This was a group project of mine in my Junior year over the Summer. Thank you to my teammates, I'll always appreciate the time we had together.*

The app uses Firebase for backend services, including Firebase Authentication for user login and Cloud Firestore for data storage and synchronization. It runs on both Android and iOS platforms.

If you're planning to use production mode, note that Firestore's default test mode Security Rules expire after 30 days. To keep access to your users' data, remember to update these rules before they expire.
Add API key info in /lib/firebase_options.dart.
