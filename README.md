# Flutter Food Delivery App
This is a cross-platform food delivery application created during my junior year as a group project over the summer. The app uses Firebase for backend services, providing user authentication, real-time data synchronization, and seamless functionality on both Android and iOS platforms.

A special thank you to my teammatesâ€”I'll always appreciate the time we had working together!

## Features 
* **Secure login and registration** using Firebase Authentication.
